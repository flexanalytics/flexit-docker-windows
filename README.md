## Installation Instructions

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

The repo's `.env` file defines project-level variables. Should you need to update ports or install versions, you can edit them there. Otherwise keep the defaults.

```dotenv
## -- frontend app setup -- ##
FLEXIT_PORT=3030
FLEXIT_VERSION=latest

## -- backend db setup -- ##
CONTENT_DB_VERSION=latest
DB_PORT=5432
```

### 2. Install The Software

In an **administrator** powershell session, run `.\install.cmd`.
This will install the needed software and allow you to configure the backend credentials. 

The application will automatically start after this script is complete. 
You may need to reboot the server if docker was not previously installed.

### 3. Start the Application

call the below start script to start the application
```bash
./scripts/start_server.sh
```
or on windows
```bash
./scripts/start_server.bat
```

### 3. Access FlexIt
Visit the application at:
- **First Install**: `http://localhost:<FLEXIT_PORT>`
- **After Optionally Configuring SSL**: `https://DNS_NAME`
